            <h2>OPEX Model (Build-Own-Operate)</h2>
            <p>If you want to avoid the investment and the performance risk, ”OPEX/BOO” is the solution you are looking
                for. Under the OPEX/BOO renewable energy solutions model, you only pay for the renewable energy
                consumed, with zero investment on the asset, and you get round the clock clean energy using our solar,
                wind or wind solar hybrid solution along with energy storage. Typical cost savings for a consumer ranges
                from 20% to 40% lower than the grid tariffs. Operation and maintenance will be handled by us. Sign a
                Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with us to save on your power cost.
            </p>

            <h2>Renewable Energy Services Company (RESCO)</h2>
            <p>The RESCO Model is favoured by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for solar rooftop
                installation, and is effectively the same as the OPEX Model, in which the customer only pays for the
                energy consumed, at a tariff lower than the grid electricity tariff, with zero investment, thus saving
                money in the process. The RESCO Model is used by various Government ministries to issue tenders to
                install rooftop solar plants, particularly on buildings owned or operated by the government, educational
                institutes and non-profit organizations. Both the Central and State Government agencies sometimes
                provide subsidies and favorable regulations for RESCO solar developers.</p>

            <h2>CAPEX Model (EPC)</h2>
            <p>If you are interested in acquiring ownership of a renewable energy plant, CleanMax offers the opportunity
                to invest in the project. Whether you prefer a rooftop solar plant or an off-site solar/wind/wind solar
                hybrid farm, our team will install the facility on your behalf. This investment model is commonly known
                as the "CAPEX" model, wherein you, as the power consumer, become the proud owner of the asset itself.

                Once the installation is complete, our team of expert engineers will diligently monitor and maintain the
                plant's operations under a comprehensive operation and maintenance agreement. This ensures that your
                renewable energy facility operates at peak efficiency, maximizing its potential and lifespan.

                By opting for the CAPEX model, you not only gain ownership of the asset but also enjoy the additional
                benefits of carbon footprint reduction. Moreover, you can take advantage of tax benefits through
                accelerated depreciation, enhancing the financial appeal of your investment.</p>
